# Basic-Portfolio

This is a basic profile website to advertise my work as a software developer. Currently it is a required deliverable (homework assignment) that satisfy requirements for a coding bootcamp I am taking, but I plan to develop it into something that will be publicly deployed.

Its currently only requires some basic HTML and CSS with no JavaScript functionality.
